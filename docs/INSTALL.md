# Installation

This document intentionally follows the current Hermes plugin model instead of assuming a generic Python virtualenv layout.

## 1. Prerequisites

Use a current first-party Hermes installation. Current Hermes documentation says its active runtime is Python 3.14, while Presidio Analyzer 2.2.364 declares Python `>=3.10,<3.15` and includes Python 3.14 support. The plugin's `pyproject.toml` therefore declares Python `>=3.14,<3.15`.

The plugin has these Python dependencies:

- `presidio-analyzer[langextract]>=2.2.364,<2.3`
- `cryptography>=50,<51`

Hermes's current plugin package manager reads a neighboring `pyproject.toml`, asks for dependency consent, and prepares the enabled plugin dependency union before activation.

## 2. Copy the plugin into the active Hermes profile

For a user plugin:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.hermes/plugins/privacy-gateway
cp -R /path/to/hermes-privacy-gateway/. ~/.hermes/plugins/privacy-gateway/
```

If you use a non-default `HERMES_HOME` or a separate Hermes profile, use that profile's plugin directory instead. The alias database follows Hermes's profile-scoped plugin storage.

## 3. Generate the alias-vault key

Run:

```bash
cd ~/.hermes/plugins/privacy-gateway
python scripts/generate_key.py
```

It prints a URL-safe base64 string representing exactly 32 random bytes.

Set it as:

```text
HERMES_PRIVACY_GATEWAY_KEY=<generated value>
```

Store it through the active Hermes profile's normal secret/environment mechanism. `plugin.yaml` declares it through `requires_env` with `secret: true`, so Hermes can prompt for it during installation/enablement flows that support credential prompting.

### Back up this key separately

The encrypted alias database cannot be recovered without it. The plugin also writes a key-check marker and will refuse an existing vault when a different master key is supplied, preventing silent alias drift.

## 4. Install the configured spaCy model

`nlp.yaml` uses:

```text
en_core_web_lg
```

Presidio's official documentation states that the required spaCy/Stanza models must be downloaded before use, and its current default English NLP configuration uses `en_core_web_lg`.

Install that model **inside the Python environment that actually runs Hermes**:

```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg
```

Hermes's managed runtime does not expose a normal `pip` command. On Hermes
installations using the managed Python 3.14 environment, install the matching
spaCy model wheel with Hermes's pinned `uv`:

```bash
uv pip install --python /path/to/hermes/venv/bin/python \
  --no-deps \
  https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases/download/en_core_web_lg-3.8.0/en_core_web_lg-3.8.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

The model is distributed as a GitHub release asset rather than a normal PyPI
package, so it is intentionally not listed as a `pyproject.toml` dependency.

Do not assume your system Python is the Hermes runtime. Verify the interpreter used by your Hermes installation/profile first.

Because spaCy language models are separate model packages rather than a normal dependency declared in this repo, re-check this model after a Hermes runtime/environment replacement.

## 5. Run Hermes Plugin Doctor

From the plugin directory:

```bash
hermes plugins doctor . --ci
```

Hermes documents Plugin Doctor as exercising discovery, manifest parsing, namespaced import, `register(ctx)`, hook registration, and tool registration using the same plugin paths as the runtime.

Fix all errors before enabling the plugin.

## 6. Enable the plugin

```bash
hermes plugins enable privacy-gateway
```

Confirm it is enabled:

```text
/plugins
```

or use the relevant Hermes plugin-list/status command for your surface.

## 7. Configure settings

See [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md). A conservative starting configuration is available in:

```text
examples/hermes-config.yaml
```

The most important secure defaults are already in `plugin.yaml`:

- `block_non_text_content: true`
- `rehydrate_tool_allowlist: []`
- `enable_langextract: false`

## 8. Run the local smoke test

Once Presidio and `en_core_web_lg` are available:

```bash
export HERMES_PRIVACY_GATEWAY_KEY='...'
python scripts/smoke_test.py
```

Expected properties, not exact aliases:

1. The sanitized output should not contain the detected raw person's name/email.
2. It should contain stable typed aliases.
3. The restored output should return the original values.

## 9. Configure a hard egress boundary

Do not stop at the plugin if your requirement is "raw Gmail text must not reach a cloud LLM."

Hermes documents middleware failures as fail-open. The recommended deployment is:

```text
Hermes -> local fail-closed proxy -> cloud provider
```

and a network policy that prevents Hermes from contacting the cloud provider directly. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
